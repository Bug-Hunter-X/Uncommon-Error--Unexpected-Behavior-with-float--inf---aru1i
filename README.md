This code demonstrates an uncommon error in Python related to the use of float('inf').  The function `function_with_uncommon_error` returns positive infinity when the divisor is zero. While this is technically correct in terms of mathematical limits, it can cause unexpected issues if not handled carefully.  The solution shows how to replace this with an exception for better error handling.
